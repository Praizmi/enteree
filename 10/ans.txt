You are tasked with designing a system to handle user authentication for a web application. Describe the steps you would take to:
(a)-Hash and store passwords securely.
(b)-Authenticate users when they log in.

(a)- I will use the md5 function to hash the password after it is sent from the form "$newPassword = md5($password)" and store it as $newPassword 
"UPDATE users SET password='$newPassword', created_at=NOW() WHERE id=$userId".

(b)- I will store the login details in different variables which are checked in the database for the exact users details and store it in a session.
