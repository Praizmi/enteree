Describe how you would implement role-based access control (RBAC) in a Laravel application.

- After installation and Migration of the base models and modules
- The Registration form as an end-user will carry a check box for roles which will be verified by a predefined admin before the user is activated.
-At the login the system checks what role the user is registered in before he log's in
- I will create a modules for each user role(admin, agent, user etc)
    also creating grouped routes for the application defining which route is for which module
    which wil help manage the web based user data for whatever role
